# markdown-resume
The simplest possible resume workdown from markdown source.

Changing the content or styling of a resume or CV is a relatively common event that can be a frustrating, time-consuming hassle. This repo contains starter files for the simplest possible workflow where resume *content* is maintained in a simple markdown file and generating `.html`, `.pdf` and `.docx` output formats can be automated with two tools: `pandoc` and `wkhtmltopdf`. 

**Still trying to decide if this is the workflow for you? Here are the original markdown files and the three output files for your persual**: 

[Markdown](files/resume.md) . [HTML](files/resume.html) . [PDF](files/resume.pdf) . [Word Doc](files/resume.docx)

[Full work flow details](http://sdsawtelle.github.io/blog/output/simplest-markdown-resume-workflow.html) are contained in a short blog post.
